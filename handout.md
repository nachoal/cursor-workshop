# Workshop Handout: AI Augmented Web Development with Cursor

## 1. Introduction to AI-Augmented Development

AI-augmented development leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in coding tasks, enhancing productivity and creativity in software development.

## 2. Understanding LLMs

- **Transformer Attention**: The mechanism allowing LLMs to process and generate text by focusing on relevant parts of the input.
- **Autoregression**: The process by which LLMs generate text one token at a time, based on previous tokens.
- **Tokens and Context Window**: Tokens are units of text processed by LLMs. The context window is the maximum number of tokens an LLM can consider at once.
- **RLHF vs. Pure Completion Models**: RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) models are fine-tuned for specific tasks, while pure completion models generate text based solely on patterns in training data.
- **Function Calls Encoding**: A technique allowing LLMs to interact with external functions or APIs.

## 3. DSL Design Patterns

Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) are specialized languages for particular problem domains. Knowledge of Common Lisp or Ruby can be beneficial for understanding DSL design patterns.
